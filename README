github-backups
-- automatic backups from g.trancendent.ink to github using CI
---
Copying
-- copying this repo for personal use should be extremely easy; 
-- this project is basically just a standard configuration of github.com/wearerequired/git-mirror-action
-- you can find an example in ./example.yml
---- you'll have to change the URLs to your personal ones
---- as well as add your secret key to your repo secrets
---- and make sure your pubkey is either a deploy key or already present on your account
---- you can also set SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS but it is not required
---
Shortcomings
-- currently Github does not automatically create a repo on push
---- thus a user will need to first create all the required repos
---- I personally used github-cli for this
---- but it's likely that a more advanced configuration could check if a repo exists
---- and then create it if its missing before applying the mirror
